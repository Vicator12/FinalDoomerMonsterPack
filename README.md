# FinalDoomerMonsterPack
An addon for Final Doomer which replaces certain vanilla monsters with new monsters that utilise the weapons of Final Doomer according to the specific weapon set that most players on a map are using.

Any bug fixes, changes, criticism, sprite additions, bug reports and feedback are welcome!

This addon needs feedback on whether the multiplayer-based monster spawner works as intended, as I don't know any way to test the feature using a single computer.

This addon needs new sprites for the new monsters. You can send your sprites made for this addon to this link:[PLACEHOLDER]. The sprites need to be given in a .WAD/.PK3 file.

You will be mentioned in the credits if you contributed to the addon, such as adding sprites, reporting bugs, providing bug fixes/changes or providing feedback on the addon.

Todo List:
- Add sprites for the monsters
- Playtest the addon
- Fix the laser/rail attacks of AV and TNT Arachnotron
- Balance the monsters
- Nerf the Whitemare burning effect (probably by removing the burn effect when the player is healed, but I haven't found a way to implement that. Need suggestions)
- Implement the rage mechanism of the cyberbosses in a way that is fair and does not softlock the player in maps with tight corridors and enclosed spaces (rage mechanism will be toggleable in the menu. Rage mechanism may not be in the final release!)
