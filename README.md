# FinalDoomerMonsterPack
An addon for Final Doomer which replaces certain vanilla monsters with new monsters that utilise the weapons of Final Doomer according to the specific weapon set that most players on a map are using.

Any bug fixes, changes, criticism, sprite additions, bug reports and feedback are welcome!

This addon needs feedback on whether the multiplayer-based monster spawner works as intended, as I don't know any way to test the feature using a single computer.

This addon needs new sprites for the new monsters. You can send your sprites made for this addon to this link:[PLACEHOLDER]. The rules for making the sprites are as follows:
- Sprites must be in a .WAD/.PK3 file
- It must not be AI-generated
- It must match the style of the weaponset and the PWAD the weaponset is based on
- It should resemble the stock monster
- It must not create confusion as to what the monster actually is (i.e., humanoid flame trooper sprites for the Whitemare Arachnotron, which would make the player think it is a chaingunner/shotgunner instead of an arachnotron)
- If you are basing the sprites on existing sprites(does not include stock sprites), create a credits text file and mention the creator(s) behind the sprites you based your sprites on

Note: HellBound Zombieman must wield only one revolver and not the same revolver the player uses. It could wield the Plutonia revolver if you want.

You will be mentioned in the credits if you contributed to the addon, such as adding sprites, reporting bugs, providing bug fixes/changes or providing critical feedback on the addon.

# Todo List:
- Fix the Monster Spawner event handler (currently it doesn't work on some maps)
- Add sprites for the monsters
- Playtest the addon
- Fix the laser/rail attacks of AV and TNT Arachnotron
- Balance the monsters if they are way too hard during playtesting
- Nerf the Whitemare burning effect (probably by removing the burn effect when the player is healed)
- Implement the rage mechanism of the cyberbosses in a way that is fair and does not softlock the player in maps with tight corridors and enclosed spaces (rage mechanism will be toggleable in the menu. Rage mechanism may not be in the final release!)
